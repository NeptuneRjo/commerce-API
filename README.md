# Commerce API

Commerce API is an eCommerce API that allows users to create and manage online stores.

This project is my interpretation of an API with moderate-complexity, and roughly follows the `Commerce.Js` API in structure and idea.

The goal is to create an easy-to-use system that just requires an account to use. After logging in, the user receives their API keys,
which can be used to create and manage stores, items, and carts.

To round out the skills used in building Commerce API, I also wrote documentation that can be viewed [here](https://app.theneo.io/personal/commerce-api).

## Technologies Used

I used `ASP.NET`, `SQL`, and `Azure` to build this project.

## Approach

I utilized the Repository Pattern to build this API due to its modularity and maintainability.

I intend to add more features in the future, so the ability to easily expand upon the project was important 
(and building maintainable applications is an important practice regardless...).


## Status

Commerce API is still in progress. A frontend to demo the project as well as additional features are being worked on.
